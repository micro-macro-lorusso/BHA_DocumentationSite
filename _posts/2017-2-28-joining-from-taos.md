# Joining BHA4 from Taos, NM

## Have begun building sterile hood hack

 I have started a hacked/artsy version of the sterile hood using a Holmes air purifier that arrived yesterday and a wooden chair for the frame. I have also ordered supplies for the incubator and found some old cameras at a thrift store in Taos.
