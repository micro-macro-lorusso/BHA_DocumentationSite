#Cultured dirt and skin and dirt on skin  

Some results from my proposed experiment on the soil microbiome and the skin microbiome and seeding my skin microbiome with the soil microbes from three different sources: Chimayo (renowned as a site of healing dirt), Taos Pueblo, and Mother Dirt (Nitrosomonas Eutropha).

Dirt cultured on skin and then on plates (48 hours each):
